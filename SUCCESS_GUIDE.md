# 🎉 XELDA - SUCCESSFULLY FIXED!

## ✅ **Issue Resolved**

The JSX syntax error in the icons file has been fixed! The problem was:
- **Line 37**: `</g>` was incorrectly used instead of `</svg>`
- **Fixed**: Changed the malformed `<g>` tag to proper `<svg>` tag in CozyIcon

## 🚀 **To Start XELDA:**

**Open Command Prompt (cmd) and run:**
```cmd
cd C:\Users\Dell\Desktop\xelda-ai
